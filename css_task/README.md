# Baykar Frontend Case Study

This project is a responsive web application based on a provided Figma design, implemented using Next.js, Tailwind CSS, and additional CSS for styling. The project adopts an atomic design architecture to facilitate scalability and ease of maintenance.

## Overview

The application is designed to be fully responsive, ensuring compatibility with a wide range of devices and screen sizes. By leveraging the principles of atomic design, the project is structured into atoms, molecules, organisms, templates, and pages, creating a comprehensive library of reusable components.

## Technologies

- **Next.js**: Chosen for its server-side rendering capabilities, ease of routing, and integration with React.
- **Tailwind CSS & Custom CSS**: Used for styling, with Tailwind CSS providing utility-first classes that speed up the development process, and custom CSS for additional specific styling needs.
- **AOS (Animate On Scroll)**: Implements smooth and animated scroll loading effects for a more dynamic user experience.
- **Swiper**: Utilized for creating responsive and interactive sliders and carousels within the application.

## Features

- **Responsive Design**: The layout adapts to different screen sizes, ensuring a consistent user experience across all devices.
- **Dynamic Design Elements**: Functionalities such as forward and backward buttons for navigation within elements, enhancing interactivity.
- **Animation and Interactivity**: Leveraging AOS for element animations on scroll and Swiper for carousel features, the application provides a lively and engaging user interface.
- **Atomic Design Architecture**: Structured for scalability and ease of modifications, facilitating future developments and simplifications in adding or removing elements through modifications in arrays.
